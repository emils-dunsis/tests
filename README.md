# Some information about HTML and CSS

This document is a markdown document. We can find some more infomration about how markdown works here https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

This is what GitHub uses when there's a file with the extension `.md` and it renders it into webpages.

## HTML


## CSS


To add in a stylesheet we need a file like `styles.css` which we then include in our HTML like this:

```html
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

This then loads the stylesheet file called `styles.css`
